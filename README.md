# Horiseon-marketing-agency-accessability-edits

Consolidated and accessibility focused code edits for Horiseon website.

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This code has been created and edited to help make it more accessible to users and clients. Throughout the code I've minimised the CSS and the HTML where possible to make edits easier, as well as the website quicker. I've also added comments where needed to make it obvious to those working on it next what they need to look for. 

Throughout this I've learnt a lot about how CSS can be changed and how parent and child selectors can be used to help minimise the amount of code needed. I've also learnt about IDs, Classes and display blocks.
